# FreQQ: Frequency-Native Quantum Compiler

**Patent Pending**

FreQQ introduces the first **frequency-native quantum compiler** â€” a novel programming paradigm that bridges symbolic frequency and geometric constructs with pulse-level control across quantum and hybrid computing systems.

Current quantum programming approaches rely heavily on gate-based abstractions (QASM, Qiskit, Cirq) that obscure the pulse-level nature of real quantum hardware. FreQQ enables developers to think and program **natively in the frequency domain**, providing a more intuitive and physically aligned method for controlling quantum and hybrid systems.

## What FreQQ Enables

- **Symbolic frequency-based programming**
- Compiler-generated **pulse-level control sequences**
- Optimized quantum circuits (QASM, Qiskit Pulse)
- Full **3D frequency-phase visualizer**
- Hybrid classical / quantum orchestration
- Applicability across **quantum, neuromorphic, RF, and analog systems**

## Why It Matters

FreQQ provides a new layer of abstraction that:

âœ… Matches how quantum hardware operates (frequency, phase, pulse shaping)  
âœ… Makes quantum programming more **intuitive and visual**  
âœ… Opens new opportunities for **pulse-level optimization**  
âœ… Bridges the gap between **symbolic reasoning** and **hardware control**  
âœ… Extends naturally into **hybrid and emerging computing domains**
